# OUTPUT üëáüèª
# The **national language of Pakistan** is **Urdu**.  

# However, **Pakistan recognizes multiple official languages**, including:  
# - **Urdu** (National language and lingua franca)  
# - **English** (Official and widely used in government, education, and business)  

# Additionally, several **regional languages** are spoken across Pakistan, such as:  
# - Punjabi  
# - Sindhi  
# - Pashto  
# - Balochi  
# - Saraiki
# - And others

# While Urdu serves as the national symbol of unity, different provinces often use their native languages in daily communication.
